//! # Testing
//!
//! This module should contain test helpers. Most of these are going
//! to be found in [`org-test.el`]. Note that this is not a complete
//! port of `org-test.el`, as the interactive components are out of
//! scope for this project, being a part of the org-emacs integration,
//! not a fundumental part of org.
